            <p>CSS RESPONSIVE LAYOUT</p>
            By default, every site is responsive until we take away the responsivity, even without css, site are still responsive by default, website wants to be responsive but most developers take awaythe responsivity, one of the way they do that is through declaring heights and width with the wrong unit.
            every child element take 100% of the height and width of their parent elementwhen the height and width are not specified and thus they become responsive on all screen.
            sometimes, a developer might want to have space around the elements in the container and they think that can be solved by adding more height and width whereas the best way to solve the issue is through adding padding
